# PSPP-MAX-PROBABILITY-Problem
## Tackling the problem of finding the optimal bi-criteria path maximizing the survivability parameter with respect to constrained distance parameter

### The algoithm is based on **DP1** algorithm presented in the **research article**:

Halman, N., Kovalyov, **Bi-Criteria Path Problem with Minimum Length and Maximum Survival Probability**, 
OR Spectrum: Quantitative Approaches in Management, Springer; 
Gesellschaft f√ºr Operations Research e.V., vol. 41(2), (2018), pp. 469-489.

#### *You can simply run it in Visual Studio.*
##### *input file contains a network consting of 23 nodes*

## In examples, the following network is used:
#### Arcs are associated with *lengths* and *survivabilities*

## Examples of running tests on different values {*start_node*, *end_node*, *max_length*}
